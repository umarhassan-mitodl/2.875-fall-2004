Textbook

Whitney, Daniel E. _Mechanical Assemblies: Their Design, Manufacture, and Role in Product Development_. New York, NY: Oxford University Press, 2004. ISBN: 9780195157826.

Course Goals
------------

While much is written about the design and manufacture of individual parts, there is surprisingly little information about how those parts go together into a product that actually does something. This course addresses the following question: What is a competently designed assembly, and how would we know one if we saw one? Specific objectives for students include:

*   Understand a systematic approach to analyzing assembly problems.
*   Appreciate the many ways assembly influences product development and manufacturing.
*   See a complete approach that includes technology, systems engineering, and economic analysis.
*   Get a feeling for what is technologically feasible.
*   Practice the systematic process on a semester-long project of your own.
